      wisdom: 'The spider symbolizes all our fears: the fear of pain, of being bitten, illogical phobias. These fears are often normal protective mechanisms that keep us safe from danger. But when they become excessive, they paralyze us. The Bible says: "God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind." Faith doesn\'t deny danger, but it gives us the courage to face it. In Christ, we learn to distinguish between healthy caution and paralyzing fear. God\'s perfect love casts out fear!'

It\'s the voice that sows doubt about God\'s goodness, pushing us toward compromise and disobedience. But the Bible teaches: "Resist the devil, and he will flee." Temptation is not sin - it\'s the invitation to sin. Jesus himself was tempted, but he resisted through God\'s Word. At the Cross, Christ crushed the serpent\'s head. Through his victory, we have the power to resist and overcome all temptation. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to us!'

      defeated: '🦅 VICTORY OVER FALSE FEARS!\n\n"Fear not, for I am with you." (Isaiah 41:10)\n\nYou have conquered imaginary fears! You now walk in wisdom, not in madness.',
      wisdom: 'The crazy chicken represents the false subjective fears that drive us mad: "What if I fail?", "What if people judge me?", "What if I\'m not good enough?". These imaginary fears, these catastrophic scenarios in our heads paralyze us and hold us back. We panic like a frightened chicken over things that may never happen! The Bible says: "God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind." 95% of our fears never come true. These subjective fears are not reality - they are lies from the enemy to stop us from moving forward. "Do not be anxious about anything" - God calls us to replace false fears with faith, panic with peace, catastrophic scenarios with trust in His providence.'

      wisdom: 'Death is not an end, but a transformation. Through Christ, we pass from earthly life to eternal life.

Even in illness, even in trials, HOPE and OPTIMISM give us wings and make the impossible often possible! The Bible says: "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom." Every day is precious. Every breath is grace. The Christian faith teaches us that death was defeated at the Cross, and that the hope of resurrection lights our way. Let us therefore live fully, with joy and gratitude, for "This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it!" (Psalm 118:24)'
